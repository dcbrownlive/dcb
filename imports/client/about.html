    The Tangerine Bot is a friendly little bot i (sikorama) have developped for The Tangerine Club, a fantastic band you
    can find on twitch, bandcamp, instagram, and many other social networks.

    This bot is currently working for some streamers, such as:
    {{#each c in enchan}}
    <a href="http://twich.tv/{{c.channel}}">{{c.channel}} &bull;
    </a>
    {{/each}}

    <h4> Collected data</h4>
    All data are collected for the solely purpose of improving your interaction with the bot/the streamer.
    In particular, location associated with nicknames are used for greeting people when they enter in the chat, in
    a personalized way (taking account of the local language and local time ).
    Geolocation ise not accurate, and is event are a bit randomized (for example the icon on the map will move every time you refresh the map).

    You can remove all informations associated with yout nickname with !forget command in chat.
